# GLESContextAndroid
This project sets up GLES context in Android, creates a native object, and renders to the display from native code. The rendering call simply changes the screen color to blue. OpenGL ES and GLSL versions are displayed on the screen using Java. We use an AsyncTask to communicate across GL and UI threads in Android.
